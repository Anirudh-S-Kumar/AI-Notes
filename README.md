# AI Notes
Notes that I took while making cheat sheets for CSE643 (Artificial Intelligence) course at IIIT-Delhi. All of them are made using markdown and compiled using pandoc. The notes are available in the form of pdfs in the `pdfs` folder. The source code is available in the `md` folder.

### How to compile
- Install pandoc
- Run `pandoc -V geometry:margin=<margin>in  md/<input_file>.md -o pdfs/<output_file>.pdf`
